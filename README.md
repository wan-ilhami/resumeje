## What is ResumeJe?

ResumeJe is an AI-powered toolset that helps job seekers build, optimize, and manage professional resumes.

**Core features:**

- **Resume Builder** — structured live-editing builder with cloud autosave, a completion meter, and multiple export formats (PDF, DOCX)
- **Upload & Enhance** — bring an existing PDF, DOCX, or TXT resume (or import a LinkedIn profile) and let AI parse and rewrite it section by section; scanned, image-only PDFs are handled with OCR
- **ATS Checker** — score a resume against a job description to surface keyword gaps before an applicant tracking system does
- **Cover Letter Generator** — tailored cover letters generated from your resume and the target role
- **Templates** — professional resume templates, previewable before you commit
- **Job Application Tracker** — companies, roles, statuses, and notes in one pipeline
- **Career Tools** — skills analysis, application packs, and interview preparation
- **Account & Privacy** — Google or email sign-in, full data export, and one-click account deletion

Building, analyzing, and generating require a free account, because every resume is stored against your user.

## This Repository

This is the **public** repository for ResumeJe. It is the public showcase, the data-contract reference, and the release tracker. The `frontend` and `backend` source code lives in separate private repositories.

**What's here**
- Public product description and feature overview
- The canonical `ResumeFormData` shape — the contract every surface shares
- A high-level architecture summary
- Live version tracking for frontend and backend (auto-updated on every release)
- Local development orchestration scripts (`package.json`) used by maintainers to run both private packages together

**Not here**
- Frontend or backend source code
- Endpoint documentation, server configuration, or infrastructure detail
- Environment variables, secrets, or connection strings
- Database schema or AI prompt templates

## Current Versions

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| Frontend | <!-- FRONTEND_VERSION -->1.4.0<!-- /FRONTEND_VERSION --> |
| Backend | <!-- BACKEND_VERSION -->1.5.0<!-- /BACKEND_VERSION --> |

Versions update automatically: each push to `master` in the frontend or backend runs semantic-release, which dispatches a `version-updated` event here. GitHub Actions then refreshes this table and cuts a release on this repo.

## The Data Contract

Every ResumeJe surface — builder, ATS checker, cover letter generator, exports, templates — reads and writes one canonical shape:

```ts
interface ResumeFormData {
  profileImage?: string | null;
  fullName: string;
  jobTitle: string;
  email: string;
  phone: string;
  state: string;
  linkedin?: string;
  portfolio?: string;
  professionalSummary: string;
  education: EducationItem[];
  experience: ExperienceItem[];
  skills: { category: string; skills: string }[];
  certifications: string[];
  projects: ProjectItem[];
  languages: string[];
  strengths?: string[];
  keyAchievements?: string[];
  interests?: string[];
}
```

Saved resumes live in the account's database record; the resume currently being edited is held in application state and mirrored to the browser's local storage so a reload doesn't lose work. Because every surface reads the same shape, an edit in the builder flows straight into the cover letter generator, the ATS checker, the templates, and every export.

## Architecture

```
centralized-resume (this repo — public)
    Public showcase + data contract + release tracker + dev orchestration

frontend (private — Next.js 16, React 19)
    Product UI, server-side routes, account data, admin tooling

backend (private — Express 5 on Bun)
    File parsing and OCR, AI inference, ATS scoring
```

The browser never calls the parsing/AI service directly. Every request goes:

```
Browser → frontend server routes → backend service
```
